### Maps

As [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) mentioned in [30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) page, this map challenge is NOT a competation. Although this repo sorts maps by their favoriate count and retweet count. This repo never intend to compare all the wonderful maps but create a altas of inspiring maps for a reference. I am also interested in exploring topis in replies in those maps with more attention (if i have time).
